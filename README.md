## Overview

MLE-Agent is designed as a pairing LLM agent for machine learning engineers and researchers. It is featured by:

- ü§ñ Autonomous Baseline: Automatically builds ML/AI baselines and solutions based on your requirements.
- üèÖEnd-to-end ML Task: Participates in Kaggle competitions and completes tasks independently.
- üîç [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/) and [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/) Integration: Access best practices
  and state-of-the-art methods.
- üêõ Smart Debugging: Ensures high-quality code through automatic debugger-coder interactions.
- üìÇ File System Integration: Organizes your project structure efficiently.
- üß∞ Comprehensive Tools Integration: Includes AI/ML functions and MLOps tools for a seamless workflow.
- ‚òï Interactive CLI Chat: Enhances your projects with an easy-to-use chat interface.
- üß† Smart Advisor: Provides personalized suggestions and recommendations for your ML/AI project.
- üìä Weekly Report: Automatically generates detailed summaries of your weekly works.

## Get started

### Installation

#### From PyPI

```bash
# With pip:
pip install -U mle-agent

# With uv:
uv pip install -U mle-agent
```

#### From source

<ol>
<li>Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MLSysOps/MLE-agent.git
cd MLE-agent
```
</li>

<li> Create & activate a virtual env

```bash
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate      # Linux/macOS
```

<li> Editable install

```bash
pip install -e .               # or: pip install -e .
```

</li>
</ol>

### Usage

```bash
mle new <project name>
```

And a project directory will be created under the current path, you need to start the project under the project
directory.

```bash
cd <project name>
mle start
```

You can also start an interactive chat in the terminal under the project directory:

```bash
mle chat
```

## Use cases

### üß™ Prototype an ML Baseline

MLE agent can help you prototype an ML baseline with the given requirements, and test the model on the local machine.
The requirements can be vague, such as "I want to predict the stock price based on the historical data".

```bash
cd <project name>
mle start
```

### :bar_chart: Generate Work Report

MLE agent can help you summarize your weekly report, including development progress, communication notes, reference, and
to-do lists.

#### Mode 1: Web Application to Generate Report from GitHub

```bash
cd <project name>
mle report
```

Then, you can visit http://localhost:3000/ to generate your report locally.

#### Mode 2: CLI Tool to Generate Report from Local Git Repository
```bash
cd <project name>
mle report-local --email=<git email> --start-date=YYYY-MM-DD --end-date=YYYY-MM-DD <path_to_git_repo>
```

- `--start-date` and `--end-date` are optional parameters. If omitted, the command will generate a report for the default date range of the last 7 days.
- Replace `<git email>` with your Git email and `<path_to_git_repo>` with the path to your local Git repository.

### :trophy: Start with Kaggle Competition

MLE agent can participate in Kaggle competitions and finish coding and debugging from data preparation to model training
independently. Here is the basic command to start a Kaggle competition:

```bash
cd <project name>
mle kaggle
```

Or you can let the agents finish the Kaggle task without human interaction if you have the dataset and submission file
ready:

```bash
cd <project name>
mle kaggle --auto \
--datasets "<path_to_dataset1>,<path_to_dataset2>,..." \
--description "<description_file_path_or_text>" \
--submission "<submission_file_path>" \
--sub_example "<submission_example_file_path>" \ 
--comp_id "<competition_id>"
```

Please make sure you have joined the competition before running the command. For more details, see the [MLE-Agent Tutorials](https://mle-agent-site.vercel.app/tutorial/Start_a_kaggle_task).
